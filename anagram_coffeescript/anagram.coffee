  # helper functions `toSubject` and `matches` exist on the instance but without the
  # context of 'this' aka '@'. This is a way to create functions that

  toSubject = ( str )-> new AnagramSubject( str )

  # a partially applied function that _returns_ a new function
  # configured for the instance. This is necessary here because this
  # is not a class method (like constructor or match) so we have no reference to
  # @anagramSubject. If we configure our function inside the instance method then
  # we can pass in the reference we need.
  # This goes back to our code vs data discussion. this function is pure code;
  # data is provided 'at runtime'

    # there are a couple other ways to do this but there is
    # no specific CoffeeScript way for this case

    # `Array.prototype.concat.apply( [], strings )`
    # but with the CoffeeScript sugar for prototype `::`

    # each word passed to it from filter

    # apply toSubject to all the words, find the ones that match
    # via our matcher function and then get the original version of the

    # `@` aka `@toSubject`

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# an alternative (maybe better) implementation
# by passing a string to the comparison, and creating
# the comparison object inside the isEqual method we:
# - don't have to remember what the original word was
# - we don't have to map to and from the comparison class
# however,
# - it is always nicer for comparisons to compare two equal things
# ultimately this is a personal judgment call
